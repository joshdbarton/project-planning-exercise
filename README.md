# Project Planning Exercise - Inventory App

In this project, you will take a short project description and break the project down into smaller tasks. These won't be "user stories" exactly, but rather an opportunity to take a large coding task, and break it down into smaller coding tasks that you can accomplish with functions and modules that are reusable, well-organized, and sufficiently small (only do one thing).

## Project Description

You are going to build a small terminal application to interact with the inventory of a hardware store. When the program starts, the user should be presented with a friendly greeting. The app should then present options for the user to choose from. The options will include viewing all items in the inventory, adding an item, removing an item, and editing an item's details. We also want to allow the user to view a report of low-inventory items (items with a quantity less than three). The user should continue to be presented with options until they choose to quit the program.

## Instructions

1. Create comments in `main.js` that break this project down into its main pieces of functionality.
1. Create module files in the project that reflect these main pieces of functionality.
1. Put comments in those modules to describe the different things they need to do.
1. Add comments to main.js to describe the main logical flow of the program.
